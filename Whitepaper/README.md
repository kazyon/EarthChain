[Whitepaper Version 1.0 -alpha]<br><br>

This is the whitepaper for Earthchain Blockchain, a resource of the Herophilos community.
Earthchain represents the first step to industrialize blockchain technology, and by creating a lightweight blockchain we know that it will be compatible on all of the devices. 

This is the main source code repository for the Earthchain project. 

## Notes
    * Earthchain is still under active development and it is still evolving. 
    * We will be launching a live testnet of the Earthchain protocol in the near future. - [sign up here to join the testnet]

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
</center>
Smart contract platforms and cryptocurrencies have captured mass attention but still have not been able to achieve mass adoption due to scalability and user experience issues. Even on Ethereum, which is the most widely used smart contracts platform, there have not been many examples of DApps which have seen mass adoption. There have been a few cases where one or the other particular application temporarily succeeded in achieving a significant user base, but it led to crippling of the entire network during the high network load times. Essentially this means that even the most advanced and widely used platforms are not ready for mass adoption yet.
<br><br >
The lightweight Earthchain network will strive to solve the scalbility and usability issues, while not taking any shortcut to compromise on decentralization and leveraging the existing developer community and ecosystem.
It will be a very powerful and scalable blockchain that will provide scalability and superior user experience to DApps/user functionalities.
<br/><br/>
On the other hand, there are a few smart contract platforms which boast of higher transaction throughput, but they compromise on decentralization in order to improve transaction speeds. Also, many of the upcoming solutions propose developing their own blockchains, neglecting the billions of dollars of market cap that DApps and other projects have already created on platforms like Ethereum and others. More importantly, they neglect the massive developer community and developer ecosystem that currently exists on platforms like Ethereum.
<br><br >
<b>The Herophilos development team has chosen to develop the first industrial decentrantralized platform that will have scalability and a working implementation very soon on the test network </b> 

We expect to reduce the transfer time to 0, exchange and conversion of digital assets (e.g. crypto tokens) and cryptocurrencies in the future. 

Herophilos Limited has the intention to provide Earthchain wallet, payment API's and SDK's, products, identity solutions and other enabling solutions that will allow developers to design, implement DApps .The most important key pillar that lives at the foundation of Earthchain is the improvement of user experience, this representing a very undeveloped area of Blockchain applications. The Herophilos team plans to build high quality user experience Mobile/Web Browser libraries which will enable businesses to create real world end user applications on a large scale. In our development RoadMap of our industrial blockchain network will include supporting cross-chain transfers and third-party Decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, etc.
